TO DO LIST

** Long-Term Aim
1. The cursor could be clicked and `moved` in OrthView to select different 
   slice dynamically.
2. Slice number in GridView should change dynamically to fit the width of 
   the ImageView widget.
3. Link the OrthView to the ROI selector.
4. Coordinate panel could be used to select a specified position.
5. Reverse direction of sagittal image in OrthView to fit users' experience.

All features above could be added `smoothly`.
